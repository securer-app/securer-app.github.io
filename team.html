  <h4>Hello.</h4>
  <p> Well. At this time the team is formed only by me: Felipe. So i will give you a short bio:</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>I'am Felipe Vieira. A former Google Summer Of Code 2016 Student.<br/>
  I spend lot's of my time developing curious and usefull things on Android , C , Ruby and Javascript.
  Since i was a child a loved Cryptography. Hiding things in plain sight just freak me out.</br>
  In our world hiding things on plain sight is the only way to go. All networks can be sniffed and a intruder could gain a massive amout of data
  if things weren't carefully encrypted. That's why things like SSL and SSH exists.<br/>
  Securer tries to solve a HUGE problem: password management. The weakest part of all sites and common user data.
  So, help me securing the world.
